# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct (v2.1) â€” Short version

We want this project to be a welcoming, harassment-free experience for everyone. All participants are expected to be respectful and kind.

## Our standards
Examples of unacceptable behavior include:
- Insults, demeaning comments, or exclusionary language.
- Harassment, stalking, or threats.
- Deliberate disruption of discussions or work.

## Enforcement
If someone is violating the Code of Conduct, maintainers may remove content or block users. When requesting enforcement, please include:
- A link to the content (issue/PR comment/etc).
- A brief description of the incident.

Contact: If you need to report an incident privately, open an issue titled `PRIVATE: CODE OF CONDUCT REPORT` or email the maintainers (add maintainer contacts here).

## Attribution
This project uses the Contributor Covenant v2.1 as its base. See https://www.contributor-covenant.org/ for the full text.
